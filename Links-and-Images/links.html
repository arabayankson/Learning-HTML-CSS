<h1>Links</h1> 
<p><a href="images.html">Images</a></p>  
<p>This particular page is about links. There are 3 types of links</p> 
<p><ul>
    <li>Absolute Link: They are the most detailed way you can refer to a websource. For Eg. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</li>
    <li>Relative Link: they point to another file in your website from the vantage point of the file you are editing. For eg. <a href="misc/extras.html">Extras Page</a>.</li>
    <li>Root Relative Links:I am trying to understand the explanation of this one. They point to another file in your website from the vantage point of the file being edited.
        <b>It is implied that the scheme and domain name are the same as the current page, so the only thing you need to supply is the path.</b>
        <b>for example,Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
    page</a>.</b>
    </li>
</ul></p>
<p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a
   href='links.html'>links</a> and <a href='misc/extras.html'>useful
   extras</a>.</p>
   <h2>JPGs</h2>
   <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
